This is Password manager that stores the username and password locally. 
I have used Tkinter module for the GUI development.
This application can also generate random password. The input will be the size/length of the password.
The length password should atleast be 8.
I have used Pycharm as my IDE.
TECH STACK
    1.	Python
    2.  Tkinter: It is used to create the user interface of the password manager. It provides the main window, input fields, buttons, and message boxes.
    3.  Text File Handling: Passwords are saved in a text file (passwords.txt). The application reads from and writes to this file to add, retrieve, list, and delete passwords.
